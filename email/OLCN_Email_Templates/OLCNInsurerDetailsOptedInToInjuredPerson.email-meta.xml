    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.OLCN_FormFirstName__c},


Thank you for completing the online form on the State Insurance Regulatory Authority website (SIRA). I am writing from SIRA&apos;s Claims Advisory Service (CAS) regarding your recent request to find
out who to claim compensation with.


1. Your reference number:
{!Case.CaseNumber}


2. The insurer of the vehicle you believe is at fault:
{!Case.OLCN_Insurer__c}
Ph : {!Case.OLCN_InsurerPhone__c}


This insurer now has your basic personal and accident details, and you can expect to hear from them in five working days.


3. What you can do now:
If you have not already done so, you will need to report your accident to the police. Call the Police Assistance Line on 131 444.

Being in a motor accident can be stressful and it may take some time to recover.
Visit our Injury Advice Centre where you will find easy to understand, practical advice to help you (or someone you know) recover after a motor accident.


4. If you need assistance:
For more information on making a claim, see our website.

If you do need any further help, the SIRA Claims Advisory Service can provide you with information and assistance throughout the claims process. You can contact us on 1300 656 919.

Please do not reply on this email, if you have any enquiries please send your email to motor@sira.nsw.gov.au
